### Introduction ###
I always found it very annoying how there was no middle ground between walking at a snails pace, and a hasty jog. This annoyance infuriated me because there is a perfectly fine brisk walk available and fully functional, but for some reason you can only use it at camp.

I present you Fast Walking Outside Camp! A mod I've wanted since the PS4 release of the game, but never had the smarts to make. Well here it finally is, so y'all can FWOC off anywhere you want now.

### How to FWOC ###
Gamepad - simply push your left stick all the way in any direction to start FWOCing. If you want to walk slower, all you have to
do is relax the stick a bit.

Keyboard - Mod  is currently a bit broken when using a keyboard. I strongly recommend Jewel's Scroll Wheel Movement Speed Control instead, which I have personally used a lot until I decided I preferred using a pad for RDR2 https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/441.
