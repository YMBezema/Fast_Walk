### Introduction ###
I always found it very annoying how there was no middle ground between walking at a snails pace, and a hasty jog. This only annoyed me further because there is a perfectly fine brisk walk animation available and fully functional in the game already, but for some reason you can only use it at camp.

I present to you Fast Walking Outside Camp! A mod I've wanted since the PS4 release of the game, but never had the smarts to make. Well here it finally is, so y'all can FWOC off anywhere you want now.

### How to FWOC ###
The mod is toggled on and off with the 'Push to Talk' key (N by default). Rebind this key as you see fit.

Gamepad - With your left stick, you can now precisely control your walking speed all the way to the brisk walking speed you get when 'running' in camp. 
If the mod stops working for whatever reason, make sure you didn't accidentally toggle the mod off with N.

Keyboard - You will always fastwalk, but can toggle back to normal walking speed with the Push to Talk key (I recommend you rebind this). 


### Installation ###
This mod requires Alexander Blade's ScriptHook http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/ .

Simply place FastWalk.asi in your Red Dead Redemption 2 folder, the same folder you can find and executable called `PlayRDR2`.

### Uninstallation ###
Remove FastWalk.asi from your Red Dead Redemption 2 folder. This mod can be safely installed and uninstalled at any time.

### Source Code ###
Is available in the downloads section on the Nexus mod page. You are free to use the source code as you see fit, though a kudos would make me happy.
